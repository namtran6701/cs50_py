# 1. While Loop
- if we are stuck in an infinite loop, try hitting "Control + C"

# 2. For loop

- we can use _ to represent a feature to loop over a range or a list. We can do this to signal people that this variable name does not matter as we move forward. 

- This is also a more pythonic way than using "i"
for _ in range(3):
    print("meow")
